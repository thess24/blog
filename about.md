### About this blog

The goal of this blog is to be a good **intermediate** level resource for quantitative minded people. I spend a ton of time reading about, using, creating, and thinking about statistical models and this is a place to share the distilled info on what I know (or great resources I’ve found). I’d like to focus on giving an intuition for why things work the way they do, point out what not to do, and go in depth on overlooked areas.   

#### Main Topics:
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- System Design + Architecture
- Quant Finance
- Bayesian Modelling
- Latest ML Research + Interesting Techniques
