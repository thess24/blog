### Well, Books and Resources Actually...

> "If you think education is expensive, try ignorance" - Unknown


I read, build things, and take online courses. A lot. 

So much so, that people will often come to me asking for the best technical resources I'm aware of in different areas. To me, the benefit of possibly gaining just one small insight from a book is easily worth the price.  Below are some of the resources I recommend (with comments). 


#### System Design
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://amzn.to/2WzPOkF)
- [Web Scalability for Startup Engineers](https://amzn.to/2PB8cs1)
- [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview) the online coursed (paid)
- [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate) online course (paid) for AWS solutions architect certifications
- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) mostly for the links at the bottom


#### Bayesian Stats / Modelling
- Statistical Rethinking the [book](https://amzn.to/335RVzi) and [the course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI)
Version 2 of the book is coming out sometime in 2020, which looks even better than the original based on some drafts I've seen from Richard McElreath's website.
- [Probability Theory: The Science of Logic](https://amzn.to/36pCIuX)

#### Finance
- Margin of Saftey

#### Math (Linear Algebra Mostly)
- [Linear Algebra and its Applications](https://amzn.to/36qJpN8)
- [Challenging Mathematical Problems With Elementary Solutions, Vol. 1](https://amzn.to/36kEBJn)
Interesting math problems/puzzles
- [Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions](https://amzn.to/2C0vJuv)

#### Machine Learning
- [Elements of Statistical Learning 2](https://amzn.to/324wOvW) (aka ESL2)
Well known for a reason and offered for free online. Also see [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://amzn.to/2oHKr6C) (aka ISL) for a more introductory text
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://amzn.to/2C6hPXL)
- [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://amzn.to/2N6a5v2)
- [Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms](https://amzn.to/2q9MeBQ)
- [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](https://amzn.to/2WFbdJh)
The best book on regressions that I've found. And check out Gelman's wonderful blog as well.

#### Deep Learning
I've skimmed a few deep learning books and nothing has caught my eye - the field is just moving too fast right now and the understanding of how even the basics work is changing.
- Fast.ai
- Twitter
- Read papers

#### Stats/Probability
- [All of Statistics](https://amzn.to/2r2XlNb)
- Think Stats

#### Python
- [High Performance Python](https://amzn.to/2PA43EK)
I haven't looked at too many Python books in the past few years, but this one has stuck out as a good one.  The second edition is also being released sometime in 2020.

#### Big Data
- [High Performance Spark](https://amzn.to/334ASxo)
A little outdated, but good for the basics. 

#### CS + Other Software
- [Operating Systems: 3 Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- [Site Reliability Engineering](https://amzn.to/2WBDtN6)

#### Algos and Data Structures
